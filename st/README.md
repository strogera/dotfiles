#st - simple terminal v0.8.4
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
This is my version of st and you can find the patches I've applied in the AppliedPatches folder.
Visit https://st.suckless.org/ for more.


###Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


###Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install
